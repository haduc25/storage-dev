As said by the error, in react-navigation version 4, all navigators have been moved to separate repos so you have to install them separately.

For the StackNavigator you have to install react-navigation-stack using:

npm i react-navigation-stack   //or yarn add react-navigation-stack
after that, go to the file where you define createStackNavigator and change:

import { createStackNavigator } from 'react-navigation'
to:

import { createStackNavigator } from 'react-navigation-stack'
