<!--
//HTML Audio
-The HTML "<audio>" element is used to play an audio file on a web page.

//The HTML <audio> Element
-To play an audio file in HTML, use the "<audio>" element:

//Example
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>HTML Audio</title>
</head>
<body>

			<h2>The HTML audio Element</h2>

			<audio controls>
				<source src="Audio/warrior.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
				Your browser does not support the audio element.
			</audio>
</body>
</html>


<!--
//HTML Audio - How It Works
-The "controls" attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.
-The "<source>" element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser 
    may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.
-The text between the "<audio>" and "</audio>" tags will only be displayed in browsers
    that do not support the "<audio>" element.


//HTML <audio> Autoplay
-To start an audio file automatically, use the "autoplay" attribute:

//Example
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

			<h2>HTML audio Autoplay</h2>

			<audio controls autoplay>
				<source src="Audio/warrior.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
				Your browser does not support the audio element.
			</audio>
</body>
</html>

<!--
*Note: Chromium browsers do not allow autoplay in most cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed.
-Add "muted" after "autoplay" to let your audio file start playing automatically 
    (but muted):

//Example
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

			<h2>HTML audio Autoplay (but Muted)</h2>

			<audio controls autoplay muted>
				<source src="Audio/warrior.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
				Your browser does not support the audio element.
			</audio>
</body>
</html>
