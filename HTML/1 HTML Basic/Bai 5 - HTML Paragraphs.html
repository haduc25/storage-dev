<!--HTML Paragraphs

-A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.
-The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
-A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

//Example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

//HTML Display

-You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
-Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
-With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
-The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

	<p>
		This paragrap
		contains a lot of lines
		in the source code,
		but the browser ignores it.
		(automatic swap to 1 lines)
	</p>

	<p>	
		This paragraph
		contains      a lot of spaces
		in the source     code,
		but the    browser 
		ignores it.  		(automatic swap to 1 lines)	
	</p>

	<p>	
		The number of lines in a paragraph depends on the size of the browser window. If you resize the browser window, the number of lines in this paragraph will change.
	</p>
</body>
</html>

<!-- HTML Horizontal Rules

-The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
-The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
*The <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
	<h1>Hello Everyone !</h1>
	<p>Friday, 30 July 2021</p>
	<hr> 

	<h2>Hello Everyone !</h2>
	<p>Friday, 30 July 2021</p>
	<hr>

	<h3>Hello Everyone !</h3>
	<p>Friday, 30 July 2021</p>
	<hr>
</body>
</html>

<!--HTML Line Breaks

-The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
-Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:
*The <br> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.
//Example
	<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>

//The Poem Problem
-This poem will display on a single line:
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
	<p>In HTML, spaces and new lines are ignored</p>

	<p>
		My bonnies lies over the ocean.

		My Bonnie lies over the sea.

		My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

		Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
	</p>

</body>
</html>

<!--Solution - The HTML <pre> Element

-The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
-The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:

//Example - use <pre> write poem
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
	<p>In HTML, spaces and new lines are ignored</p>

	<pre>
		My bonnies lies over the ocean.

		My Bonnie lies over the sea.

		My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

		Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
	</pre>

</body>
</html>
