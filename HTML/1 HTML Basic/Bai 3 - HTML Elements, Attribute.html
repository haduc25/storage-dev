<!-- An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
	<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

-Examples of some HTML elements:
	<h1>My First Heading</h1>
	<p>My first paragraph.</p>

Start tag			Element content			End tag
<h1>			My First Heading			</h1>
<p>				My first paragraph.			</p>
<br>				none					none

*Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!
-->

<!--Nested HTML Elements

-HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements)
-All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.
-The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>):

//Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

	<h1>My First Heading</h1>
	<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>


*Example Explained

-The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.
-It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.
-Then, inside the <html> element there is a <body> element:
		<body>

		<h1>My First Heading</h1>
		<p>My first paragraph.</p>

		</body>

-The <body> element defines the document's body.
-It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>.
-Then, inside the <body> element there are two other elements: <h1> and <p>:
		<h1>My First Heading</h1>
		<p>My first paragraph.</p>

-The <h1> element defines a heading.
-It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1>:
		<h1>My First Heading</h1>

-The <p> element defines a paragraph.
-It has a start tag <p> and an end tag </p>:
		<p>My first paragraph.</p>
-->


<!-- Never Skip the End Tag
-Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag:

//Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body> 

	<p>This is a paragraph.
	<p>This is a paragraph.

</body>
</html>

*However, never rely on this! Unexpected results and errors may occur if you forget the end tag!
-->

<!-- HTML is Not Case Sensitive

-HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
-The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.
-->

<!-- HTML Tag Reference


Tag							Description
<html>					Defines the root of an HTML document
<body>					Defines the document's body
<h1> to <h6>			Defines HTML headings
-->

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<!--HTML Attributes 

-HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
	+All HTML elements can have attributes
	+Attributes provide additional information about elements
	+Attributes are always specified in the start tag
	+Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"


#The href Attribute

-The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:
//Example:
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>HTML Attributes </title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>The href Attribute</h2>

	<p>HTML links are defined with the a tag. The link address is specified in the href attribute:</p>

	<a href="https://www.facebook.com">Visit Facebook</a>
</body>
</html>

<!--The src Attribute 

-The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:
//Example:
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
	<h2>The src Attribute & width, height</h2>
	<p>HTML images are defined with the img tag, and the filename of the image source is specified in the src attribute:</p>

	<img src="Image\background.png" width="700" height="450">
	<!-- get image with link -->
	<img src="https://www.pixsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/edi-libedinsky-1bhp9zBPHVE-unsplash-1-1536x1024.jpeg" width="700" height="450" >
</body>
</html>

<!--There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

*Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.
-->

<!-- The alt Attribute 
-The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

//Example
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>The alt Attribute</h2>
<p>The alt attribute should reflect the image content, so users who cannot see the image gets an understanding of what the image contains:</p>

<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket" width="500" height="600">

</body>
</html>

<!-- The style Attribute
-The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

//Example
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
	<h2>The style Attribute</h2>
	<p>The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color:</p>

	<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

<!--The lang Attribute

-You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
-The following example specifies English as the language:
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html lang="en">
		<body>
		...
		</body>
		</html>

-Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.
-The following example specifies English as the language and United States as the country:
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html lang="en-US">
		<body>
		...
		</body>
		</html>
-->

<!-- The title Attribute

-The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
-The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:

//Example:
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
	<h2 title = "I'm a header">The title Attribute</h2>
	<p title="I'm tooltip">Mouse over this paragraph, to display the title attribute as a tooltip.</p>
	<p title="Hello">Hold mouse this text</p>
</body>
</html>

<!--This example will not display the title attribute correctly, because it contains a space:
//Example
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p title="About Me">You cannot omit quotes around an attribute value if the value contains spaces.</p>
	<!-- su dung dau "" co the viet cach nguoc lai chi duoc 1 tu
		use: <p title="About Me">You cannot omit quotes around an attribute value if the value contains spaces.</p>
		not use: <p title=About Me>You cannot omit quotes around an attribute value if the value contains spaces.</p>
	-->
	<p><b>
		If you move the mouse over the paragraph above, your browser will only display the first word from the title.
	</b></p>
</body>
</html>

<!-- Single or Double Quotes? 

-Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.
-In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:
		<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>

Or vice versa:

//Example
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>Single or Double Quotes?</h2>
<p>In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:</p>
<p>Move your mouse over the paragraphs below to see the effect:</p>

<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>John with double quotes</p>
<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">John with single quotes</p>

</body>
</html>
