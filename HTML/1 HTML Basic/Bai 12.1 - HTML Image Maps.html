<!--HTML Image Maps
-With HTML image maps, you can create clickable areas on an image.

//Image Maps

-The HTML <map> tag defines an image map. An image map is an image with clickable areas. The areas are defined with one or more <area> tags.
-Try to click on the computer, phone, or the cup of coffee in the image below:
//Example - Here is the HTML source code for the image map above:
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>HTML Image Maps</title>
</head>
<body>

		<h2>Image Maps</h2>
		<p>Click on the computer, the phone, or the cup of coffee to go to a new page and read more about the topic:</p>

		<img src="Image/workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap" width="400" height="379">

		<map name = "workmap">
			<area shape="rect" coords="34,44,270,350" alt="Computer" href="Bai 12.1.1 - HTML Image Laptop.html">
			<area shape="rect" coords="290,172,333,250" alt="Phone" href="Bai 12.1.2 - HTML Image Phone.html">
			<area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" alt="Cup of Coffee" href="Bai 12.1.3 - HTML Image Coffee.html">
</body>
</html>

<!--How Does it Work?

-The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform different actions depending on where in the image you click.
-To create an image map you need an image, and some HTML code that describes the clickable areas.


//The Image

-The image is inserted using the <img> tag. The only difference from other images is that you must add a usemap attribute:
				<img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">

-The usemap value starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the image map, and is used to create a relationship between the image and the image map.

*Tip: You can use any image as an image map!

//Create Image Map

-Then, add a <map> element.
-The <map> element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required name attribute:
				<map name="workmap">

-The name attribute must have the same value as the <img>'s usemap attribute .

//The Areas

-Then, add the clickable areas.
-A clickable area is defined using an <area> element.

//Shape

-You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:

	rect 		- defines a rectangular region
	circle 		- defines a circular region
	poly 		- defines a polygonal region
	default 	- defines the entire region

-You must also define some coordinates to be able to place the clickable area onto the image. 

//Shape="rect"

-The coordinates for shape="rect" come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis.
-So, the coordinates 34,44 is located 34 pixels from the left margin and 44 pixels from the top:
...
-The coordinates 270,350 is located 270 pixels from the left margin and 350 pixels from the top:
...
-Now we have enough data to create a clickable rectangular area:
//Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

		<h2>Image Maps</h2>

		<img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap" width="400" height="379">

		<map name="workmap">
		  <area shape="rect" coords="34,44,270,350" alt="Computer" href="computer.htm">
		</map>

</body>
</html>

-This is the area that becomes clickable and will send the user to the page "computer.htm":


//Shape="circle"

-To add a circle area, first locate the coordinates of the center of the circle:
337,300
-Then specify the radius of the circle:
44 pixels
-Now you have enough data to create a clickable circular area:
//Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

		<h2>Image Maps</h2>
		<p>Click on the cup of coffee to go to a new page and read more about the topic:</p>

		<img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap" width="400" height="379">

		<map name="workmap">
		  <area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" alt="Cup of coffee" href="coffee.htm">
		</map>

</body>
</html>

-This is the area that becomes clickable and will send the user to the page "coffee.htm":


//Shape="poly"

-The shape="poly" contains several coordinate points, which creates a shape formed with straight lines (a polygon).
-This can be used to create any shape.
-Like maybe a croissant shape!

-How can we make the croissant in the image below become a clickable link?
-We have to find the x and y coordinates for all edges of the croissant:

-The coordinates come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis:
//Example:
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

		<h2>Image Maps</h2>
		<p>Click on the croissant to go to a new page and read more about the topic:</p>

		<img src="Image/croissant.jpg" alt="French Food" usemap="#foodmap" width="450" height="675">

		<map name="foodmap">
		  <area shape="poly" coords="140,121,181,116,204,160,204,222,191,270,140,329,85,355,58,352,37,322,40,259,103,161,128,147" alt="Croissant" href="Bai 12.1.4 - HTML Image Croissant.html">
		</map>

</body>
</html>

<!--Image Map and JavaScript

-A clickable area can also trigger a JavaScript function.
-Add a "click" event to the <area> element to execute a JavaScript function:

//Example - we use the onclick attribute to execute a JavaScript function when the area is clicked:
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

			<h2>Image Maps Work Place</h2>
			<p>Click on the cup of coffee to execute a JavaScript function:</p>

			<img src="Image/workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap1" width="400" height="379">

			<map name = "workmap1">
				<area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" href="Bai 12.1.3 - HTML Image Coffee.html" onclick="myFunction()">
			</map>

			<script>
				function myFunction()
				{
					alert("You clicked the coffee cup!");
				}
			</script>
</body>
</html>
