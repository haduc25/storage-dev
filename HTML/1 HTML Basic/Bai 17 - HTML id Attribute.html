<!--HTML id Attribute
-The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.
-You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.

//Using The id Attribute
-The "id" attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the "id" attribute must be unique within the HTML document.
-The "id" attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.
-The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.
-In the following example we have an "<h1>" element that points to the id name "myHeader". This "<h1>"element will be styled according to the "#myHeader" style definition in the head section:
//Example
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>HTML Id Attribute</title>
		<style>
				
				#myHeader
				{
					background-color: lightblue;
					color: black;
					padding: 40px;
					text-align: center;
				}
		</style>
</head>
<body>

			<h2>The id Attribute</h2>
			<p>Use CSS to style an element with the id "myHeader":</p>

			<h1 id="myHeader">My Header!</h1>
</body>
</html>

<!--
*Note: The id name is case sensitive!
*Note: The id name must contain at least one character, cannot start with a number, and must not contain whitespaces (spaces, tabs, etc.).

//Difference Between Class and ID
-A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page:
//Example:
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
		<style>
			/* Style the element with the id "myHeader1" */
			#myHeader1
			{
				background-color: lightblue;
				color: black;
				padding: 40px;
				text-align: center;
			}

			/* Style all elements with the class name "city" */
			.city
			{
				background-color: tomato;
				color: white;
				padding: 10px;
			}
		</style>
</head>
<body>

			<h2>Difference Between Class and ID</h2>
			<p>A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page:</p>

			<!--An element with a unique id -->
			<h1 id="myHeader1">My Cities (used ID)</h1>

			<!-- Multiple elements with same class -->
			<h2 class="city">London</h2>
			<p>London is the capital of England.</p>

			<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
			<p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>

			<h2 class="city">Ha Noi</h2>
			<p>Ha Noi is the capital of Viet Nam.</p>			
</body>
</html>

<!--HTML Bookmarks with ID and Links
-HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a webpage.
-Bookmarks can be useful if your page is very long.
-To use a bookmark, you must first create it, and then add a link to it.
-Then, when the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.

//Example  - (Bai 11.2 - HTML Links - Create Bookmarks.html)
-First, create a bookmark with the "id" attribute:
			<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>

-Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page:
			<a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>

-Or, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from another page:
			<a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>

//Using The id Attribute in JavaScript
-The "id" attribute can also be used by JavaScript to perform some tasks for that specific element.
-JavaScript can access an element with a specific id with the "getElementById()" method:
//Example - Use the "id" attribute to manipulate text with JavaScript:
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
			<style>
				#myHeader2
				{
					background-color: black;
					color: white;
				}
			</style>
</head>
<body>

			<h2>Using The id Attribute in JavaScript</h2>
			<p>JavaScript can access an element with a specified id by using the getElementById() method:</p>

			<h1 id="myHeader2">Welcome to my World!</h1>
			<button onclick="displayResult()">Change Text</button>

			<!--JavaScript-->
			<script>
				function displayResult()
				{
					document.getElementById("myHeader2").innerHTML = "Have a nice day!";
				}
			</script>
</body>
</html>
